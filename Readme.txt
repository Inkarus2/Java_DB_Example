example project with basic interaction with local database

this architecture is a first try and not quite good

interaction with table:
CREATE TABLE Kunden (
    id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    stadt VARCHAR2(50)
);
